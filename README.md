# Translator
Goal of this application is for the user to input some text and for it to be translated. 
Used translate and tkinter module(for style and translation)
User inputs text on one side and the other side outpus the information. I want thhe output text to be stored in a txt file for the user to reference translated text. 
Running into an error in translating the text I keep getting an object error. 
Everything else is running properly.
